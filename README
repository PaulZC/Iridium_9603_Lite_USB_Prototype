# Iridium 9603 Lite USB Prototype #
###################################

A prototype design for a very small, lightweight, USB-powered Iridium 9603 satellite communication module.
The final design will be approximately 35mm x 44mm x 18mm and weigh close to 33g (including the antenna).

Tested with Python 2.7 on Windows 10 and Debian Linux (Raspberry Pi).

The USB interface is provided by a Cypress CY7C65213 USB-UART Bridge.

Power for the Iridium 9603 is provided by a Linear Technology LTC3225EDDB supercapacitor charger.
